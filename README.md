# Module-1-RefactorCode
Modify Existing Code to have accessibility

The starter code given had issues, therefore I had to find and fix them (aka debug)
The first issue was the linking of the first header tag line, it was not linking as it was missing the "id"
The next thing was to restructure the CSS to follow semantic structure and properly comment on what is being done
The last thing was to add the accessibilty standards to the images using the Alt attributes on all the pictures and images so that an impaired person has access to all images

Because this was the first project and I was so confused in this course at the beginning, I did no even know what my assignment was asking me to do.  Our class moves very fast and the pieces of the puzzle were just scattered in the beginning.  Things are beginning to make a little more sense but a long way to go!
